I started The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy and its going pretty well.

Heres a website that we created to show the prevelance of CSS frameworks, in particular Bootstrap 5.

This website in the tutorial was done in Bootstrap 4 but I'm converting it into Bootstrap 5 to make it mor relevant.
